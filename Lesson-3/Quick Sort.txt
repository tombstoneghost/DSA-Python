Quick Sort
----------

In Quick Sort, we select a random number from the list and move all the
elements greater than it to it's right and all the small elements to it's
left. The random select number is called Pivot


Example

8 3 1 7 0 10 2
Pivot =  2

Since, 8 > 2
10 3 1 7 0 2 8

Since, 10 > 2
0 3 1 7 2 10 8

Since 3 > 2
0 7 1 2 3 10 8

Since 7 > 2
0 1 2 7 3 10 8

Now we perform the same with both the lists which are left and right to
pivot element. 

Left List = 0 1
Right List = 7 3 10 8


Efficiency
----------

Worst Cases:
    1. When the Pivot is in the right place
    2. All Numbers are Same

    O(N)

Average and Best Case:
    O(N Log(N))
