Bubble Sort
------------

Bubble Sort is a Native Approach. We keep iterating through the list
and compare all the adjacent elements and swap them if required. 


Algorithm
----------

List = [N-Elements]

FOR i in List:
    FOR J in LIST - 1:
        IF J > J + 1:
            SWAP J and J + 1


Efficiency
-----------
Since we are running each loop till (N - 1)

Therefore, Total Running Iterations are:
    (N - 1)(N - 1) = N^2 - 2N +2

Hence, Efficiency is O(N^2)
