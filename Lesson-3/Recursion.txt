Recursion
---------

Recursion is a method in which a Function calls itself on a 
particular condition. It also requires a base case which acts as a 
exit else it will be keep running infinitely. 

Example:
    Code: 
        function recursive(input):
            if input <= 0:
                return input
            else:
                output = recursive(input - 1)
                return output

    Working:
        recursive(2)
            recursive(1)
                recursive(0)
                    return 0
            output = 0
            return 0
        output = 0
        return 0
