Eulerian Path
--------------

A Eulerian Path is a Path which traverses through all the edges only once. 

A Eulerian Cycle is the one which contains a cycle in which all the edges
are travelled once. 

They can only exist if the Graph has Odd Degree. 


Hamiltonian Path
----------------

It is same has a Eulerian Path.
