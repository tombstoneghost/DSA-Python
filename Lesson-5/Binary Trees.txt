Binary Trees
------------

A Binary Tree is a Tree with each node having 2 children at max.

We have the following Tree:

            D
           / \
          /   \
         B     E
        / \     \
       /   \     \
      A     C     F


Perfect Tree: Every Node expect the one at last level have 2 children. 


Binary Search Tree
------------------

A Binary Search Tree is a tree which follows the following condition:
    Left.Value < Root.Value < Right.Value

Complexity: O(Log(N))

BST Complication:

            5
             \
              \
               10
                \
                 \
                  15
                   \
                    \
                     25

Such a binary tree is called an unbalanced binary tree and operations work
in linear time. Hence worst case complexity is O(N) but the average case
complexity is O(Log(N))
