Self-Balancing Trees
--------------------

It is the one which minimize the number of level it uses. It has some
insertion and deletion properties which helps it to stay balanced. 

A common example of this type of Tree is Red Black Tree. 


Red Black Tree
---------------

A Red Black Tree has the following Rules:
1. Nodes are assigned as Black and the End Nodes are always Red
2. Each Node which does not have 2 leaves should have 2 Null leaves
3. If a node is red, then both of it's children should be black.
4. The root node must be black
5. Every Path from a root to it's descendent must have same number of 
    black nodes. 


Inserting a Node:

> Insert Red Nodes only. 
> If the parent and it's sibling are both red, then both should be turned 
    Black
