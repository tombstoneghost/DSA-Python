Trees
-----

Trees are the data structure which starts with a root node and has branches
which are further connected to subtrees or leaves. 

A Tree is just an extension of a LinkedList. It can contain a number of
branches and each node on a tree should contain some value. 

A Tree should be:
1. Ending at some end node called leave
2. There should be no cycles. 


Terminology
-----------

Root : The First Element of the Tree
Node : It is a parent-child relationship
Level : The number of connections it take to reach root
Leaf : The node at the end of the tree. 
Height : The number of connections between a node and it's ancestor.


Tree Traversal
--------------

We have the following Tree:

            D
           / \
          /   \
         B     E
        / \     \
       /   \     \
      A     C     F


There are a 2 Broad ways to Traverse a Tree:
1. DFS - Visit all the nodes and keep digging till you visit the end
2. BFS - Level Order - Visit all the nodes on the same level

The BFS of the above tree is:  D B E A C F

There are 3 ways for DFS Traversal:
1. Pre-Order    : Root Left Right   :   D B A C E F
2. Post-Order   : Left Right Root   :   A C B F E D
3. In-Order     : Left Root Right   :   A B C D E F



Tree - 1:

            A
           / \
          /   \
         B     C
        / \
       /   \
      D     E
             \
              \
               F

Post-Order  :   D F E B C A
