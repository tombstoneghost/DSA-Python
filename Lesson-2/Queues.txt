Queues
------

A queue is opposite of the stack. It works on the FIFO Principle. 

FIFO : First In First Out

The first element is called the Head and the newest element is call Tail.


Queue Operations
-----------------

Adding element at Tail: Enqueue
Removing element at Head: Dequeue


Types of Queues
----------------

1. Deq : A queue that works on both the sides
2. Priority Queue: In this, we assign a priority to each element in the queue
