Stacks
-------

A Stack is like a stack of objects. We keep putting element at the top
and we have easy access to keep putting or checking the element at top. 

It works on LIFO Principle i.e. Last In First Out

It is useful, when you want to use the recent element. 


Stack Operations
----------------

To Add an element at Top: Push()
To Remove an element at Top: Pop()

Both of these work with the O(1) complexity.
