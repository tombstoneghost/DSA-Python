LinkedList
----------

A LinkedList is an extension of list but not an array. 

Each Element in the LinkedList has the information about where the next
element is. 

Each LinkedList has two blocks:
    1. Data
    2. Information about next Node

To Add an element: Just change the next reference and it will be done in O(1)
Removing an Element is also similar. 


Doubly LinkedList
-----------------

In a Doubly LinkedList, Each node contains the reference about its Next Node 
as well as its previous node. 



Note:
You should always take care about the references. Missing/Bad Linking 
any reference would lead to a broken LinkedList
