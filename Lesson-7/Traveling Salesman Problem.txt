Traveling Salesman Problem
---------------------------

In this, we need to finding a route in which we can cover all
the given nodes in the shortest possible time. It is a representation
of a Salesman who needs to sell his things in a number of cities, 
hence called as the Traveling Salesman Problem.

This algorithm comes under a category of NP-Hard

We can either solve it by using the Exact Answer or by
performing a Brute Force. 

But, it can also be solved using Dynamic Programming as well. 

It is considered to be one of the hardest problem in the field 
of computer science.
