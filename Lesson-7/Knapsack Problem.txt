Knapsack Problem
-----------------

In this we have a theoretical Knapsack and a number of elements with their 
respective weights and values. 

We have 0-1 Knapsack in which we can either use the complete object or not. 

In this, we can try all the combinations available and then choose the best. 
It is called a Brute Force Solution but it gives an efficiency of O(2^N)


Faster Approach
----------------

We choose the Max Value for Minimum Weight

And using this we get the efficiency of O(N X W)
