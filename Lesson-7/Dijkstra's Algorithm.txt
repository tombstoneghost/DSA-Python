Dijkstra's Algorithm
---------------------

We start by giving each vertices the distance value. It is the sum of edge weights from the starting point
to the point we are on. 

This is done using the minimum priority queue. 

Our Starting node will be 0 and rest all will be infinity initially. 
Then we keep updating it as we move from one node to another. 
Therefore, it comes under the Greedy Algorithm Category. 

Efficiency: O(V^2)

To optimize it, we can use a Priority Queue and it will give us the efficiency of O(E + V Log(V))
