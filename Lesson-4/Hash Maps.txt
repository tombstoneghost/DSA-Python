HashMaps
--------

A HashMap is the combination of a Hash and A Map.


Map<Key, Value> --> HashFunction(Value) --> HashValue<Key, Value>

HashMaps are useful to integrate with the algorithms. 


String Keys
-----------

The best part of this system is that we can use it with String Keys too. 
We need to design a HashFunction which will convert the String Key into
its respective ASCII value. 

Since, the Hash Value of the String Keys could be very large therefore
we can use another HashFunction to make it relatively smaller.
