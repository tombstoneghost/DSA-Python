Python Dictionaries
-------------------

The Map Concept in Python appears as a built-in data type called a 
dictionary. it contains key value pairs. 

We can declare a dictionary as follows:
dictionary = {}

To Add A Key:
dictionary[KEY] = VALUE

We can use the same way to access a pair:
print(dictionary[KEY])
