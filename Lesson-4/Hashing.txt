Hashing
-------

Hash Function: A Hash Function is used to convert the input value into 
    a hash value. 

A basic Hash Function is we divide the input with a number and store it. 
We use a function which will return with an array index. So that we can
access the input value in a constant time. 


Collisions
----------

A Collisions occurs when a hash function returns the same value for two
different input. Due to this, we can miss either of the input and it may
result in giving us a false positive result. 

A solution is to use dual hash functions. 


Load Factor
-----------

The purpose of a load factor is to give us a sense that how full a hash
table is. 

Load Factor = Number of Entries / Number of Buckets
